Using Task Control

-  Project directory name is task4
-  Use the inventory file & configuration file from lab1/task2
-  Write a playbook as follows:
   - install and run the mariadb database service

   - it should only install on managed nodes that are using version 8 of RHEL or CentOS
   - Only if the database service could be started successfully, the mysql_user module should be used to set the database root user password
   - ensure that the changes persist across reboots

**Task 5**

Using Modules to Manipulate Files

-  Write a playbook as follows:
   - playbook name is copy.yaml
   - runs on all hosts
   - copies local /etc/hosts into /tmp/ on the hosts
   - add the following lines to the newly copied /tmp/hosts but also ensure /tmp/hosts is backed up first
     - 192.168.4.110 host1.example.com
     - 192.168.4.120 host2.example.com
   - verify file checksum for /tmp/hosts with md5 algorithm
   - print checksum results

-  Use the inventory file & configuration file from lab1/task2
-  Write a playbook as follows:
   - runs on all hosts
   - install vsftpd
   - uses vsftpd.j2 template as follows:
     - replaces all the '?' within the template with YES values such that the values come dynamically 
     - copies the generated file as /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf on the hosts
     - ensure if there is an existing /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file, it is backed up

**Task 8**

Using Control Structures in Jinja2 Templates

-  Project directory name is task8
-  Use the inventory file & configuration file from lab1/task2
-  Write a playbook as follows:
   - runs on all hosts

     - template directory/filename is templates/hosts.j2
     - it generates hosts file within each host as follows:
       - 127.0.0.1 localhost
       - 192.168.174.132 control control.example.com
       - 192.168.174.133 ansible1 ansible1.example.com
       - 192.168.174.134 ansible2 ansible2.example.com
     - do no use static values but instead write a control structure using for or if statements. You can use static value for '127.0.0.1 localhost'
   - run the template and copy the generated file as /etc/hosts on the hosts
   - ensure if there is an existing /etc/hosts file, it is backed up
