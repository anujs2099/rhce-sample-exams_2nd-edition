**Task 7**

Working with Playbooks --> Write an Ansible Playbook as follows

-  Verify the syntax of the playbook before running it
-  Check the output of the playbook without running it
-  Run the playbook and verify that it worked

**Task 8**

-  Project directory name is task8
-  Use the inventory file & configuration file from task2
-  Playbook location is rhce-sample-exams_1st-edition/files/vsftpd-err.yaml
-  Fix the issue with the playbook but do not run it

**Task 9**

Writing Multiple-Play Playbooks

-  Project directory name is task9
-  Use the inventory file & configuration file from task2
-  All changes below should persist across reboots

   - Connect to the webserver on url http://ansible1.example.com and make sure the task displays the output from the page

**Task 10**

Writing Undo Playbooks

-  Project directory name is task10
-  Use the inventory file & configuration file from task2
-  All changes below should persist across reboots
